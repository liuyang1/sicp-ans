Creating this repo is to promote myself to insiting on reading and study this bible.

Mainly code developed by myself, and refer from SICP and guile & racket materials.

FAQ

### What is displayln?

In racket, this is a internal function.But for some else intepreter, maybe not exist this func.

So simply (define (displayln x) (display x) (newline)).

### Why you display the answer, it seem not useful?

eh..

Becuase I am a vimer, and only using a simple vim script to call intepreter to debug.

REPL, slimv and emcas is too complex to me for now.
